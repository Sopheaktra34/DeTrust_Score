# Project Name: DeTrust Score Predictor

Please read till the end to see links to the dataset and source code.

## 1. Project Overview

This project implements a **DeTrust Score system** to predict user trustworthiness using a combination of **machine learning** and **rule-based scoring**. The system classifies users as **Good User ✅** or **Default Risk ❌** and provides a detailed breakdown of their **stability, network, and behavior scores**.

The project includes:

- Model training and evaluation (XGBoost and Random Forest)
- Rule-based scoring for transparency
- A Streamlit-based frontend for interactive predictions
- Feature-level contribution analysis (+/- points)

---

## 2. Score Components

The system calculates three main scores:

1. **Stability Score (0–100)**  
   - Account Age  
   - Profile Completeness  
   - Verified Email  
   - Login Consistency  

2. **Network Score (0–100)**  
   - Connections with other users  
   - Account Maturity  
   - Social Influence (Pagerank optional)  

3. **Behavior Score (0–100)**  
   - Average Response Time  
   - Daily Message Activity  
   - Toxicity  
   - Spammy Behavior  

**Total DeTrust Score:** Weighted sum of the three components scaled to **300–850**.
